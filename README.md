## In Retrospect
* Start think about accessibility early on!!
* Use ESLint, Gulp - other task runners

## Next Steps

* When congressional people are shown - we would like to show how these people have previously voted on issues
* Breaking data down to show more local representatives
* Incorporate Tweets from politicians (able to obtain twitter handles from Google Civic API)
